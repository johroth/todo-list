<h1>General Remarks</h1>

<p>
Here we describe some general features of IMD.</p>

<ul>

<li><a id="virtual" name="virtual"><b>virtual types</b></a>
  <p>
  It is sometimes necessary to distinguish between certain classes 
  of particles, even if their chemical species und thus their interaction 
  is the same. For this purpose, the notion of virtual types is used.
  Particles in IMD can have virtual types running from <tt>0</tt> to 
  <tt>total_types-1</tt>, where <tt>total_types</tt> is a parameter. 
  The number of real types can run from 0 to <tt>ntypes-1</tt>, where 
  the parameter <tt>ntypes</tt> is a divisor of <tt>total_types</tt>. 
  Particles whose virtuals type differ by a multiple of <tt>ntypes</tt> 
  have the same interaction. </p>
</li>

<li><a id="restricted" name="restricted"><b>restricted mobility</b></a>
  <p>
  One application of virtual types is the restriction of the mobility 
  of certain particles. For each virtual type v, a restriction vector 
  can be read from the paramter file, with components 0 or 1. Particles
  of type v will be mobile only in those directions for which the
  restriction vector has value 1. Default is mobility in all directions.
  Example:
<pre>
   restrictionvector  2  1 1 0
</pre>
  restricts the mobility of particles of type 2 to the xy-plane.
  Note that the parameter <tt>total_types</tt> must be read 
  <b>before</b> any restriction vectors.</p>
</li>

</ul>
